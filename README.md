My App is a basic space invaders game where the player has to shoot waves of enemies to try and increase their score.
The game generates different sizes of enemies and the smaller the enemy shot the greater the score the user gets.




------------------------------------------------CONTROLS------------------------------------------------------------

The user can use the UP, DOWN, LEFT OR RIGHT keys on keyboard to control ship movement.  User can also use on screen 
controls on a windows tablet or phone.  

Space bar is used to fire lasers at enemeis.  There is also a RED Fire button to the right of the screen for touch users.



-----------------------------------------------DIFFICULTY SETTINGS----------------------------------------------------

Game difficulty can be cycled through EASY, MEDIUM OR HARD on the main menu screen.  Harder difficulties double and triple
the number of enemies in waves on screen.

Initial 2d scrolling, stars emitter and enemy code for this app was taken from 
https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/03/13/how-to-make-a-windows-store-game-with-c-and-xaml-part-1/
To this I added movement in the y axis and hit detection for front and back of ship.
